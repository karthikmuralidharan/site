A full-stack software engineer in Bengaluru. I'm currently work as a backend engineer at Atlassian. 

I am a Reddit junkie. I also enjoy reading stuff on [lobste.rs](https://lobste.rs), [hacker news](https://news.ycombinator.com). I try to learn a new language or technology every now and then (currently learning Clojure & Flutter / Dart), listen to podcasts (Some of my current favorites are Software Engineering Daily, Conan Oâ€™Brien Needs a Friend, and Hidden Brain by NPR, Mythology by Parcast) and audiobooks, watching tech talks, anime, and sitcoms on Netflix, and occasional travelling. 

I volunteer in tech at a non-profit as well so that keeps me occupied at times.
